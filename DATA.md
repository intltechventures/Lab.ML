  + "The Oxford Radar RobotCar Dataset is a radar extension to The Oxford RobotCar Dataset. We provide data from a Navtech CTS350-X Millimetre-Wave FMCW radar and Dual Velodyne HDL-32E LIDARs with optimised ground truth radar odometry for 280 km of driving around Oxford, UK (in addition to all sensors in the original Oxford RobotCar Dataset)."
  + "Our radar is a Navtech CTS350-X Millimetre-Wave Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) scanning radar and in the configuration used provides 4.38 cm in range resolution and 0.9 degrees in rotation resolution with a range up to 163 m, all whilst providing robustness to weather conditions that may trouble other sensor modalities."

    * "The BLS Public Data API is currently available in two versions. Version"
    * "2.0 requires registration and allows users to access more data more frequently. Users may add calculations and annual averages to requests, and series description information is available for many BLS surveys."
    * "Version 1.0 is a more limited API that does not require registration and is open for public use."

- http://congressionalbills.org/about.html
  + The Congressional Bills Project is a relational database of over 400,000 public and private bills introduced in the U.S. House and Senate since 1947. The dataset is primarily intended for use scholars and students of legislative politics. 
  + Trained human coders assign a primary topic (one of 19 major and one of 224 subtopics) to each bill based on their readings of either the short description or the title of the bill. Intercoder reliability across the 225 subtopics is very high. Intercoder disagreements can indicate coding errors, but we have found that most of them reflect legitimate disagreements about a bill's primary topic. For example, a bill proposing a health care program for children of illegal immigrants might be arguably coded as an immigration issue (530) or as a child health issue (332).
