- 2021-04-21 [Europe Proposes Strict Rules for Artificial
  Intelligence](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/business/artificial-intelligence-regulation.html)
  + "The European Union unveiled strict regulations on Wednesday to govern the use of artificial intelligence, a
    first-of-its-kind policy that outlines how companies and governments can use a technology seen as one of the most
    significant, but ethically fraught, scientific breakthroughs in recent memory."
  + "The draft rules would set limits around the use of artificial intelligence in a range of activities, from
    self-driving cars to hiring decisions, bank lending, school enrollment selections and the scoring of exams. It would
    also cover the use of artificial intelligence by law enforcement and court systems — areas considered “high risk”
    because they could threaten people’s safety or fundamental rights."
  + "This week, the Federal Trade Commission warned against the sale of artificial intelligence systems that use
    racially biased algorithms, or ones that could “deny people employment, housing, credit, insurance or other
    benefits.”"
  + "Elsewhere, in Massachusetts and cities like Oakland, Calif.; Portland, Ore.; and San Francisco, governments have
    taken steps to restrict police use of facial recognition."
