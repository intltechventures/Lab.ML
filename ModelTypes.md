  + "Core ML is an Apple framework that allows developers to easily integrate machine learning (ML) models into apps. Core ML is available on iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, and tvOS. Core ML introduces a public file format (.mlmodel) for a broad set of ML methods including deep neural networks (convolutional and recurrent), tree ensembles (boosted trees, random forest, decision trees), and generalized linear models."

  + "An MLflow Model is a standard format for packaging machine learning models that can be used in a variety of downstream tools—for example, real-time serving through a REST API or batch inference on Apache Spark. The format defines a convention that lets you save a model in different “flavors” that can be understood by different downstream tools."
