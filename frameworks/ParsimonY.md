  + Parsimony comprise three principal parts: algorithms, functions and estimators.
    * "functions define the loss functions and penalties, and combination of those, that are to be minimised. These represent the underlying mathematical problem formulations."
    * "algorithms define minimising algorithms (e.g., Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) [FISTA2009], COntinuation of NESTerovâ€™s smoothing Algorithm (CONESTA), Excessive Gap Method, etc.) that are used to minimise a given function."
    * "estimators define a combination of functions and an algorithm. This is the higher-level entry-point for the user. Estimators combine a function (loss function plus penalties) with one or more algorithms that can be used to minimise the given function."
